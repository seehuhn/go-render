# go-raster

A 2D vector graphics rasterizer for Go, implementing the PDF/PostScript imaging model.

## Overview

go-raster converts vector paths to pixel coverage values—the fraction of each pixel covered by a filled or stroked path. It produces anti-aliased output without supersampling, suitable for rendering page graphics and font glyphs.

Features:

- Fill paths using nonzero winding or even-odd rules
- Stroke paths with configurable width, caps, joins, miter limit, and dash patterns
- Quadratic and cubic Bézier curve flattening with CTM-aware tolerance
- Zero allocations in steady state through buffer reuse

## Installation

```
go get seehuhn.de/go/raster
```

## Usage

```go
clip := rect.Rect{XMin: 0, YMin: 0, XMax: 100, YMax: 100}
r := raster.NewRasterizer(clip)

r.CTM = matrix.Scale(2, 2) // optional transform
r.FillNonZero(path, func(y, xMin int, coverage []float32) {
    // coverage[i] is the coverage for pixel (xMin+i, y)
    // range: 0.0 (outside) to 1.0 (inside)
})
```
